## Objective
We have created a website that allows users to input a problem they are experiencing, and in response uses AI to generate a comprehensive step-by-step guide with accompanying images to guide the user to a solution.

## Inspiration
With improving artificial intelligence technologies on the rise <br />
- such as GPT3 and DALL·E 2 - integrating AI is becoming easier by the day. <br />
In the future, we expect many upcoming breakthroughs to come from the advancement of AI generation, and learning to utilize these technologies to create engaging and informative content is crucial.

## What It Does
We designed a website where users input a problem they are trying to troubleshoot. <br />
An example might be "My router is slow". Using the input, we create a set of instructions for the user along with images that correspond with each step, guiding the user to a solution for their problem. <br />
Searching online for solutions for specific issues can be frustrating and challenging, especially when you don't know exactly what you are looking for. We hope that having a convenient and user-focused website will reduce the amount of time people spend searching for solutions as well as give them the proper solution on the first try.

## How It Works
To build our project we used JavaScript, HTML, and the OpenAI API. <br />
Our website communicates with OpenAI to generate step-by-step processes our users can follow to solve real-world problems, using the ChatGPT model. <br />
We then use ChatGPT to generate effective prompts for related image generation, and provide these prompts to DALL·E to generate image.

## Challenges We Ran Into
Difficulty in bringing OpenAI to correctly interact with our website. <br />
Challenging to get the API to connect with our website in real-time. <br />
Many unfamiliar bugs. <br />
Difficulty getting the AI to process exactly what we want. <br />
Generating concise, but complete steps for the user. <br />
Generating easy-to-follow images with our steps. <br />
Ensuring our prompts provide enough data to generate relevant images. <br />

## Our Accomplishments
We are most proud that we were able to bring the separate components of our project to communicate. <br />
We each had specific roles to play in early development, and bringing all our pieces together as one final product was a gratifying experience. We are also proud that we were able to properly connect the OpenAI API to our project. No one on our team has experience with OpenAI, so creating a easy-to-use interface utilizing the ChatGPT and DALL·E libraries in conjunction was a huge accomplishment for our team.

## What we learned
Product planning as a team. <br />
The inner workings of OpenAI.

## Future of our Product
Improve more in-depth steps to guide the user to a solution. <br />
Allow user to provide more information to fix current solutions given. <br />
Improve our image processing to provide more "guideful" images. <br />
Create an app for user convenience. <br />
